This directory contains a diverse collection of jupyter notebooks that use UQ360 toolkit in various ways. Both tutorials and examples illustrate working code using the toolkit. Tutorials provide additional discussion that walks the user through the various steps of the notebook.

## Tutorials

- [Calibrated Housing Price Prediction](./tutorials/tutorial-synthetic_housing_dataset.ipynb)<br/>Illustrates using the housing price prediction task the consumption of uncertainties by two personas: the decision maker and the model developer. This tutorial covers the basic concepts of uncertainty quantification and evaluation in a simple regression setting.

- [Selective Classification on Adult Income Dataset](./tutorials/tutorial-adult_income_dataset.ipynb
)<br/> Shows the usage of uncertainty information to help end users and developers compare the model's performance with male v.s. female customers. This tutorial covers the basic concepts of uncertainty quantification and evaluation in the selective classification setting.
